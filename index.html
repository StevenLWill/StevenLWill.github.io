  <p>Otto, pictured on the left, is an Alaskan Malamute wolfdog. He is the sweetest boy but likes to rough house with the other dogs when he gets excited. On the sled team, he is usually a wheel dog.</p>
  <p>Aurora is the oldest dog in the pack and considers herself the alpha. She is a high content wolfdog, also mixed with an Alaskan Malamute. She loves to run and has a very high prey drive. Aurora is often one of the lead dogs.</p>
